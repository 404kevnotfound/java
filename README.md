So for my final I created a game called Bunco. Basically you will roll 3 die. If you roll a one you will keep going if not, itâ€™s the other players turn. The person with the most points and the end wins.
Code Example

		if(source == play)
		{
			if(rolls < NUMBERTURN)
			{
				playersTurns(players); 
				rolls += 1; 
			 }
			else 
			{
				winner(); 
			}
		}
Motivation
Well during a work party we actually played Bunco with like 40 people and it got crazy, so I thought it would be really fun to make the game. 
Installation

Basically all you have to do is to make sure that all the files are in one folder only. Then You will run the one the says GameFrame.

API Reference
N/A

Test
It will run it for you. I already created the main for it in the bottom. As long as you run it. I will pop the frame up for you. I will say the instructions are the best part.
